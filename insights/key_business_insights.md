## 1. Revenue Concentration in Top Products

The top 10 products generate **1,624,804** in revenue, which accounts for only **3.52%** of the total revenue (**46,096,707**).

This indicates that revenue is **highly distributed across the product portfolio**, with no heavy dependence on a small set of products. Sales performance is driven by a broad range of products rather than a few top performers, reducing concentration risk but increasing the importance of overall catalog management.

## 2. Category-Level Revenue Contribution

Revenue is **evenly distributed across major product categories**, with no single category dominating overall sales.

Sports & Outdoors (**19%**, 8,558,098) and Books (**19%**, 8,543,462) are the highest contributing categories, followed closely by Fashion (**18%**, 8,159,223) and Health & Beauty (**18%**, 8,088,602). Electronics (**15%**, 6,845,255) and Home & Kitchen (**13%**, 5,902,067) contribute comparatively less but still represent meaningful revenue shares.

This balanced category-level revenue distribution indicates a **diversified product portfolio**, reducing dependency on any single category and suggesting stable demand across multiple segments.

## 3. Customer Lifetime Value (CLTV) Distribution

The customer base consists of **900 customers** generating a total lifetime revenue of **46,096,707.42**.

The **top 5 customers** contribute **544,916.54**, accounting for approximately **1.18%** of total CLTV, while the **top 10 customers** contribute **1,036,041.21**, representing around **2.25%** of total customer revenue.

This indicates that customer lifetime value is **highly distributed across the customer base**, with no significant revenue dependence on a small group of high-value customers. Revenue is driven by a broad customer population rather than a few dominant accounts, suggesting stable demand but limited impact from individual customer retention alone.

## 4. Return Behavior and Product-Level Risk

The overall return rate across all orders is approximately **9.90%**, indicating a moderate level of returns at the aggregate level.

However, returns are **highly concentrated in a small set of products**. The highest observed return rate is **25%**, with the top returning products being **Self-Help Book 486 (25%)**, **Yoga Mat 135 (24.49%)**, and **Tablet 096 (22.92%)**.

This pattern suggests that while overall returns are manageable, **specific products exhibit significantly elevated return risk**, likely driven by product expectations, quality issues, or customer fit. Targeted product-level interventions would be more effective than broad return policy changes.


## 5. Shipping Delays and Fulfillment Risk

Out of **1,243 shipped orders**, **357 orders** experienced shipping delays of more than five days, resulting in a delay rate of **28.72%**.

This indicates that shipping delays are a **material operational issue rather than isolated exceptions**. Delays are primarily concentrated among specific logistics partners, with **Ecom Express** and **DHL** accounting for the highest number of delayed shipments.

The findings suggest that fulfillment performance can be significantly improved through **shipping partner evaluation, SLA enforcement, or route-level optimization**, rather than broad process changes.
